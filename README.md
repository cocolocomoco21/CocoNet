# CocoNet
Lightweight hybrid peer-to-peer and client/server network. Server stores registered peers, peers talk with each other.


## Geting Up and Running
### Requirements
(In process of being updated)
* Java 8
* Gradle (Install here: https://gradle.org/install/)
   
    To initialize Gradle, from the `/CocoNet` directory, run:
    1) `gradle init`
    2) `gradle wrapper`
    3) `gradle build`
* (Optional) VSCode, and the Java Extention Pack plugin
    

### Running 
I use the debugger from the Java Extention Pack in VSCode to run the server or peers.
